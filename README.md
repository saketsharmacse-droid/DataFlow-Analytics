I built this project using Python Flask to make my work with data and PDFs easier. While it also supports some basic data analytics, I personally use it the most to merge multiple PDFs and convert images into PDFs quickly, without relying on external tools.

Features

📑 Merge multiple PDF files into one

🖼️ Convert images (JPG/PNG) to PDF

📊 Perform simple data analytics on uploaded datasets

🌐 Access everything through a clean Flask web app

Why I Made This

I often had to combine notes, scanned pages, and images into a single PDF. This project helps me do that in just a few clicks. It also acts as a handy space to test my Python + Flask skills.
